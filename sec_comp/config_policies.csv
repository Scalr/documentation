scalr.server.hostname.source,Enforces a source for the computation of the Servers hostnames. This policy is commonly used in conjunction with a Hostname Template policy or a Hostname Webhook endpoint policy.,"**Affects the Network Tab of Farm Roles in the Farm Designer**. |BR| If you activate this policy, the Server Hostname Source will no longer be customizable in the Network Tab."
scalr.server.hostname.template,"Enforces a custom Hostname Template for your Servers.

scalr.server.hostname.integrations_endpoint,"Enforces a given Webhook endpoint to retrieve the hostname of your Servers from. Select an endpoint from the list of configured endpoints, and Scalr will use it to generate the hostname for your Servers","**Affects the Network Tab of Farm Roles in the Farm Designer**. |BR| If you activate this policy, the Server Hostname Webhook endpoint will no longer be customizable in Network Tab."
scalr.server.hostname.validation_pattern,"This policy creates a validation pattern for hostnames. If the hostname generated for a Server does not match the validation pattern, Scalr will abort the provisioning of the Server.",Validation patterns are defined as Regular Expressions (REGEX).
scalr.farm.name.validation_pattern,"This policy creates a validation pattern for Farm names. If the Farm name does not match the validation pattern, Scalr will prevent the farm from being created.",Validation patterns are defined as Regular Expressions (REGEX).
scalr.scaling.maximum_servers_count,"This limits the amount of servers that can be launched from a Farm Role. If the limit is reached it will prevent servers from being launched."
chef.servers,Enforces the use of a specific Chef Server to configure cloud severs.,
chef.environments,Enforces the use of a specific Chef Environment to configure cloud severs.,
ansibletower.bootstrap_configurations,Enforces the use of a specific Ansible Tower Bootstrap Configuration to configure cloud severs.,AT Bootstrap config must have previously be defined at |SCALR| or |ACCOUNT| scope.
ansibletower.require_bootstrap_enable,Enforces the use of an Ansible Tower Bootstrap Configuration.,"Force the Bootstrap Ansible Tower on the FarmRole Scope. When creating a farm with FarmTemplate, all the Farm Roles without Bootstrap Ansible Tower enabled will be ignored."
