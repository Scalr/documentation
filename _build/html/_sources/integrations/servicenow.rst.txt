ServiceNow Integration
=======================

Overview
--------

|SCOPE_SCALR| |SCOPE_ACC| |SCOPE_ENV|

Scalr provides out-of-the-box integration with ServiceNow to enable mutual customers to leverage ServiceNow for ITSM workflows including problem management, incident management, change management, asset management, and others. The Scalr ServiceNow integration allows users to maintain a single source of truth for all on premise and cloud-based infrastructure resources and services,  and leverage existing workflows, while taking advantage of Scalr for cloud infrastructure management.

CMDB Integration
----------------
Scalr integrates with the ServiceNow CMDB to record cloud-based assets, resources and configurations in ServiceNow, and maintain a single source of truth across the customer's entire IT ecosystem.

CMDB Integration Setup
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. note:: You will need to create a server to host your Webhook, this can be a small Linux server as the load should be minimal. Find out more about Webhooks here: :ref:`webhooks`.

.. |snow_doc| raw:: html

   <a href="https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/helsinki-platform-administration/page/build/applications/task/t_CreateATable.html/" target="_blank">ServiceNow Table Creation</a>

First, you will need to create a table in ServiceNow if it doesn't already exist. Please follow these instructions to do so: |snow_doc| |NEWWIN|

Next, on the server that will be hosting the Webhook, pull down the Webhook code from Git:

.. code-block:: shell

  apt update
  apt install python-pip -y

  pip install docker-compose

  curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com/ | sh
  service docker start || systemctl start docker

  git clone https://github.com/scalr-tutorials/scalr-servicenow-webhook.git /opt/snow-webhook

.. include:: /sec_comp/integrations.rst
    :start-after: endpoint_start:
    :end-before: endpoint_end

The URL above will point to the server you are hosting the ServiceNow Webhook on (http://<webhook server IP or hostname>:5018/servicenow/). Make sure to copy down the Signing Key that is generated as it will be used later on.

.. include:: /sec_comp/integrations.rst
    :start-after: webhook_start:
    :end-before: webhook_end

The Endpoint in the screenshot above will be the Endpoint that you created in the previous step. In terms of the Events, you can select as many Events as you wish, every time this event is triggered a payload will be sent to ServiceNow. By Default, the Webhook will trigger on the following events:

* BeforeInstanceLaunch
* HostInit
* BeforeHostUp
* HostUp
* BeforeHostTerminate
* HostDown
* IPAddressChanged
* ResumeComplete
* HostInitFailed

This is configurable, by updating the following line in webhook.py which is located in /opt/snow-webhook :

https://github.com/scalr-tutorials/scalr-servicenow-webhook/blob/master/webhook.py#L48

Next, log into the server that is hosting the Webhook and go to the /opt/snow-webhook directory. Copy the uwsgi.ini file:

.. code-block:: shell

  cd /opt/snow-webhook
  vi uwsgi.in

Next, edit the uwsgi.ini file to set the configuration variables:

* env = SCALR_SIGNING_KEY=Signing key that was generated after creating the Webhook Endpoint.
* env = SNOW_URL=The ServiceNow URL
* env = SNOW_USER=The user accessing ServiceNow
* env = SNOW_PASS=The password for accessing ServiceNow

You may also have to update the table name in the webhook.py, in the following example you will see that we used the name ``u_scalr_servers``, but this is configurable based on the table name you created in ServiceNow:

* https://github.com/scalr-tutorials/scalr-servicenow-webhook/blob/master/webhook_server_table_only.py#L107
* https://github.com/scalr-tutorials/scalr-servicenow-webhook/blob/master/webhook_server_table_only.py#L120
* https://github.com/scalr-tutorials/scalr-servicenow-webhook/blob/master/webhook_server_table_only.py#L133

Next, run the Webhook with Docker:

.. code-block:: shell

  ./relaunch.sh

Youâ€™re ServiceNow Webhook should now be running, you can check the logs by using the following command:

.. code-block:: shell

  docker logs -f snow-webhook

To test, build and launch a Farm, once the server reaches the Event specified in the Webhook section above, the payload will be sent to the Webhook and forwarded to ServiceNow.
