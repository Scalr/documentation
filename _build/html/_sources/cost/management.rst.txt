Cost Management
===============

Overview
^^^^^^^^
Scalr Cost Manager is Scalrâ€™s next general cost management product module. Scalr Cost Manager is being built to provide enhanced capabilities to help customers with cost tracking, budgeting, show-back/charge-back and cost optimization.

Scalr Cost Manager reflects all costs associated within a cloud account, including services provisioned by Scalr, as well as services provisioned outside of Scalr.


Feature Preview
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Scalr Cost Manager is currently in Feature Preview and requires a new license file to enable.  Please feel free to contact Scalr Support for additional questions regarding the license file.

Upon receipt of the new license file, replace the existing file (/etc/scalr-server/license.json) on the Scalr Server (either singularly on a single node install, or on every node in the Scalr deployment in a multi-node installation)  and then run `scalr-server-ctl reconfigure` on each node.

No additional configuration should be required.


Currently Supported Cloud Service Providers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Cost Manager currently supports the following Cloud Service Providers:

	* Amazon Web Services - standard and Detailed Billing
	* Microsoft Azure - Azure standard billing and Azure Enterprise Agreements Billing
	* Google Cloud Platform - Google Cloud Billing
	* VMWare - Custom Price Lists


Cost Manager Dashboard
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The new Cost Manager Dashboard is currently accessible through the |SCALR| scope only.

The data populated within the dashboard is summarized from all cloud account numbers entered as Cloud Credentials in either |ACCOUNT| Scope or |SCALR| Scope.

Price Books
^^^^^^^^^^^
Scalr Cost Manager Price Books are a new component of Scalr Cost Manager that provide an intuitive way to set prices for cloud resources. Price Books allow administrators to create Products, which can be based on one or more attributes such as cpu, memory, disk, etc. Pricing and price metrics can be established for Products with optional pricing conditions like location and/or operating system.

**Note**: Cost Manager Price Books are currently separate from Price Lists established within Scalr Cost Analytics. Cost Data reflected within Cost Analytics, as well as at the Farm level are based on Cost Analytics Price Lists, not Cost Manager Price Books. Price Lists will be merged with Price Books in later release.

Cost Manager Price Books currently supports VMWare private clouds only.
