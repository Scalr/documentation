"| Use Spot Instances||||||","* Scalr will use `Spot Instances <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-spot-instances.html>`_ where available to launch Servers.* Scalr uses RunInstances API request to launch each set of Servers required by a Farm Role.* The price table shows the current spot price for the specified Instance Type.* A Maximum price per Spot Instance can be set.* If no Spot capacity is available or Max price is exceeded the Server will fail in a Pending Launch state.
