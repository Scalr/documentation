Cloud Configuration and Credentials
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Scalr must be configured to connect to the Cloud API's of the clouds you wish to manage through Scalr. This configuration is called "Cloud Credentials". Cloud Credentials are linked to |ENVIRONMENTS| to enable Farms to be configured to use your clouds. An |ENVIRONMENT| can be linked to multiple clouds which enables DevOps to implement distributed deployments, and/or provide users with the option to choose a cloud when using Self Service deployment through the Service Catalog.

Cloud credentials in Scalr can be configured globally at the |SCALR| scope for all |ACCOUNTS| and |ENVIRONMENTS| or at the |ACCOUNT| Scope so they are restricted to |ENVIRONMENTS| within the |ACCOUNT|.

For details on configuring Scalr for the different cloud services, please follow the appropriate link(s) below.
