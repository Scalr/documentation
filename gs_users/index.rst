Getting Started for End Users
=============================

This page provides the basic information needed by |SCALR| users to begin working with |SCALR|.

**Prerequisite:** Scalr Server has been installed (See :ref:`install`) and you are able to login a user with access to at least one |ENVIRONMENT| within any |ACCOUNT|.

Types/Roles of End users

An end user's role can vary from organization to organization and their tasks can be performed within |ENVIRONMENTS|. The ability to complete specific tasks or access specific resources is determined by their ACL group.  There are two general types of end users, summarized as follows.

* **Standard End User**

 * Create and manage Farms and Service Catalog Offerings
 * Manage infrastructure
 * Configuration of items to be used across a given |ENVIRONMENT|

    * Scripts, Global Variables, Webhooks, Schedules.
    * Images and Roles.

* **Service Catalog User**

  * Consume Service Catalog Offerings
  * Manage their own Applications at a basic level, as well as their Team's Applications if granted permissions.


All tasks can be performed by clicking on the appropriate main menu button |MENU_SCALR| |MENU_ACC|.
