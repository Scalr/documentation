Images and Roles in Scalr
=========================

|SCOPE_SCALR| |SCOPE_ACC| |SCOPE_ENV|

Images and Roles are the two fundamental features of Scalr that allow you to build reusable infrastructure components. We describe Images and Roles in :ref:`terminology` and are reproducing those descriptions here for your convenience.

.. include:: /introduction/terminology.rst
