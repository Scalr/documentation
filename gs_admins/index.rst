Getting Started for Admins
==========================

This page provides the basic information needed by |SCALR| and |ACCOUNT| admins to get Scalr up and running and configured for end users to start work.

**Prerequisite:** Scalr Server has been installed (See :ref:`install`) and you are able to login as either a |SCALR| or |ACCOUNT| admin.

Role of an Administrator
---------------------------

An Administrator's role can vary from organisation to organisation and admin tasks can be performed at various scopes within Scalr. Some tasks can only be done at one specific scope and some are available at all 3 scopes. The unique aspects of these roles can be summarised as follows.

* **Scalr Admin**

 * Set up Accounts
 * Set Cost Centers (and other aspects Cost Analytics)
 * Configuration items to be used across all |ACCOUNTS|

    * Scripts, Global Variables and Orchestration rules.
    * Images and roles

* **Account Admin**

  * Create |ENVIRONMENTS|
  * Set up governance policies via the Policy Engine
  * Set up Users, Teams and Access Control Lists
  * Configuration items to be used across all |ENVIRONMENTS| in the |ACCOUNT|.

     * Scripts, Global Variables and Orchestration rules.
     * Images and roles

All tasks can be performed by clicking on the appropriate on the main menu button |MENU_SCALR| |MENU_ACC|.

The table below describes the core tasks that Admins must perform in order for End Users to be able to login, configure farms and deploy cloud infrastructure.

Set up Cost Centers                        |LS|             Cost Analytics        | Cost Centers are critical to enabling useful sub-divisions of Cost Analytics.

                                                                                  | More detail can be found at :ref:`cost_control`.

                                                                                  | More detail can be found at :ref:`accounts`.

                                                                                  .. note:: Users are unique throughout Scalr and can have access to multiple accounts. They can be created at |SCALR| or |ACCOUNT| scope but it is recommended that all User and Team management is done at |ACCOUNT| scope. The exception being that only the Scalr admin can assign Global and Cost Manager Admin privileges to a user.

                                                                                  | See :ref:`teams_users`.

                                                                                  | See :ref:`teams_users`.

                                                                                  | Environments can also be linked to Policy Groups and Resource Quotas if they are being used.

Configure Roles                            |LS| |LA| |LE|   Roles                 | Roles associated with Images must be created and configured with any required Orchestration capabilities. This can be done from scratch or it can be done by importing existing cloud servers as new Images and Roles.
                                                                                  | See :ref:`roles` and :ref:`images_from_servers`.

They are used perform actions on running servers and can include things like ensuring mandatory software upgrades and patches are applied, or they can simply perform local actions relevant to individual Farm Roles.
                                                                                    | Scripts should be created by administrators if they are required for |SCALR| or |ACCOUNT| scope Orchestration rules, including orchestration rules applied to Roles at these scopes.

Set up Endpoints and Webhooks                |LS| |LA| |LE|   Integration Hub       | Administrators must set up Enterprise or |ACCOUNT| wide external integrations via Webhooks and associate them with appropriate events. Examples of this are for integration with an IPAM system or a CMDB.
